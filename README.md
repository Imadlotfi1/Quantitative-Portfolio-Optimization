# Quantitative Portfolio Optimization Pipeline

This repository contains a comprehensive Python pipeline for advanced financial portfolio optimization. The project leverages a hybrid forecasting model (ARIMA + LSTM), GARCH for volatility, parallel processing for efficiency, and advanced risk analysis techniques like Monte Carlo simulations, VaR, and CVaR.

## My Personal Journey with this Project

This project was born from a desire to bridge academic theory with the practical, high-impact skills demanded by the competitive world of quantitative finance. As part of my "Analytic Edge" module, I recognized the need to go beyond standard models. I undertook a self-directed learning journey, completing an intensive quantitative finance course from **IMT on YouTube**, which provided a deep dive into advanced modeling techniques.

This pipeline is the direct application of that knowledge: a tool that is not just academically sound but also robust, efficient, and built with real-world performance in mind.

## üöÄ Key Features

-   **Hybrid Forecasting Model (ARIMA + LSTM):** Combines the linear modeling strength of ARIMA with the ability of LSTMs to capture non-linear patterns in financial data, using macroeconomic factors and technical indicators as features.
-   **Dynamic Volatility with GARCH:** Moves beyond simple historical volatility by forecasting future volatility for each asset using GARCH models, leading to a more forward-looking covariance matrix.
-   **Efficient Parallel Processing:** Leverages `concurrent.futures` to run forecasting tasks for all tickers in parallel, drastically reducing computation time.
-   **Markowitz Optimization with Constraints:** Uses `cvxpy` to find the optimal portfolio on the efficient frontier, incorporating practical constraints like maximum and minimum asset weights.
-   **Advanced Risk Analysis:** Calculates parametric and Monte Carlo-based Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) to provide a comprehensive view of portfolio risk.
-   **Automated Pipeline & Scheduling:** The entire process is wrapped in a main function, with an optional `APScheduler` to run the analysis automatically (e.g., on the first of every month).

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Pipeline

The script follows a structured, end-to-end pipeline:

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Downloads historical price data for a large universe of stocks and key macroeconomic indicators (`^GSPC`, `^VIX`, `^TNX`) from Yahoo Finance.
2.  **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering:** Imputes missing values using KNNImputer and engineers a rich feature set including technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI) for each asset.
3.  **Parallel Forecasting Engine:**
    -   For each asset, a hybrid **ARIMA + LSTM** model forecasts the next day's expected return.
    -   Simultaneously, a **GARCH** model is fitted to forecast the next day's volatility.
    -   These tasks are executed in parallel for maximum speed.
4.  **Covariance Matrix Construction:** Constructs a forward-looking covariance matrix by combining the historical correlation matrix with the *forecasted* daily volatilities from the GARCH models.
5.  **Portfolio Optimization:** Solves the Markowitz optimization problem to find the portfolio with the maximum Sharpe ratio, given the forecasted returns and the constructed covariance matrix.
6.  **Risk Assessment & Simulation:**
    -   Performs a **Monte Carlo simulation** over a one-year horizon to project the distribution of the portfolio's final value.
    -   Calculates daily **VaR and CVaR** to quantify potential losses.
7.  **Visualization & Reporting:** Generates key visualizations and saves the optimal portfolio weights to a CSV file.
